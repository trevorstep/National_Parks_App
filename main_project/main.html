    One Last Breath -Creed
    </p>
<p>
    Please come now, I think I'm falling
    I'm holding on to all I think is safe
    It seems I found the road to nowhere
    And I'm trying to escape
    I yelled back when I heard thunder (thunder)
    But I'm down to one last breath
    And with it, let me say, let me say
    Hold me now
    I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
    Maybe six feet ain't so far down
    I'm looking down now that it's over
    Reflecting on all of my mistakes
    I thought I found the road to somewhere
    Somewhere in His grace
    I cried out, "Heaven, save me" (save me)
    But I'm down to one last breath
    And with it, let me say, let me say
    Hold me now
    I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
    Maybe six feet ain't so far down
    Hold me now
    I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
    Maybe six feet ain't so far down
    I'm so far down
    Sad eyes follow me
    But I still believe there's something left for me
    So please come stay with me
    'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
    For you and me, for you and me
    Hold me now
    I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking (thinking)
    Hold me now
    I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
    Maybe six feet ain't so far down
    Hold me now
    I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
    Maybe six feet ain't so far down
    Please come now, I think I'm falling
    I'm holding on to all I think is safe
